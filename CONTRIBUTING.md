# ü§ù Contributing

To add a new repository to the solutions list add a new entry like this for GitHub-hosted repos:

    * [username/repo]

or like this for non-GH repos:

    * [username/repo](https://somewhere-else.com/username/repo)

Repositories not hosted on GitHub are fine, but they won't have a "last commit" badge.
